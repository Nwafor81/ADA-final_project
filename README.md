# ADAVANCE DATA ANALYSIS FINAL PROJECT
## Project Description
This repository includes the 2023 BRFSS complete dataset, a final analytic sample of 2023 BRFSS used for this and R markdown code used
to analyze it. The project is part of the final project of Advanced Data analysis with my reseach question being:"What Is the Association Between Marital Status, Insurance Status, 
and Mammography Utilization Among U.S. Women Aged 40 Years and Older Using 2023 BRFSS Data".
## Objectives of the study
-1.To assess the association between marital status and mammography utilization among U.S. women aged 40 -74 years in 2023.
-2.Assess the association between health insurance status and mammography utilization among U.S. women aged 40 -74 years in 2023.
-3.To assess effect modification by marital status on the insurance-mammography association.
## Files Included
- `BRFSS 2023 analytic sample dataset. CSV`: Cleaned version of the analytic sample of the BRFSS 2023 dataset
- `BRFSS 2023 clean dataset.CSV`: The cleaned recoded version of the BRFSS 2023 dataset with some missing values in CSV format
- `ADA PROJECT.Rmd`: R script used to summarize the analysis with some tables and visualize the data
- `README.md`: This file
## What the Code Does
- Was used to Import the BRFSS 2023 dataset
- Was used to exclude those who are not eligibe for the study
- To concatenate the key variables for the study in the dataframe
- Rename the column variables and recode the variables to meet the objectives of the study
- Write code to exclude missing values and plot a flowchart to account for the excluded values.
- Performs filtering of some variables
- Codes were used to convert vaules into weighted data for account for national spread.
- Used to determine the descriptive statistics of the study population.
- Used for bivariate and multivariable logistic regression.
- Used for model diagnostics and data management
- Figures and Tables were created with codes.
